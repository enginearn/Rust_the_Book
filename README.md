Other languages such as C lang, Ruby, you can write `x = y = 6` and the result is `x` and `y` assigned 6.
it does'nt work in Rust.

## Chapter 4

### Ownership

#### Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has a variable that's called owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

#### The String Type

<details>
<summary>String::from("hello");</summary>

> The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace thsi particular from function
> under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`.


``` rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello";
    let S = String::from("hello");
    let mut m_S = String::from("hello");

    m_S.push_str(", world!");

    println!("from m_S: {}", m_S);

#### Method Syntax

> ***Methods*** are similar to functions: we declare them with the ***`fn`*** keyword and a name,
> they can have parameters and, return value and they contain some code that's run when the method
> called from somewhere else.
> Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object),
> and their first parameter is always ***`self`*** , which represents the instance of themethod is being call on.

> **Note**
> we still need to use the ***`&`*** in front of the ***`self`*** shorthand to indicate this method
> borrows the ***`Self`*** instance, just as we did in ***`rectangle: &Rectangle`*** .
> Method can take ownership of ***`self`*** , borrow ***`self`*** immutably as we've done here,
> or borrow ***`self`*** mutably, just as they can any other parameter.

> We've chosen ***`&self`*** here for the same reson we used ***`&Rectangle`*** in the function version:
> we don't want to take ownership and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it.
> If we wanted to change the instance that we've called the method on as part of what the method does,
> we'd use ***`&mut self`*** as the first parameter.

> **Summmary**
> Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain.
> By using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each otjer and
> name each piece to make your code clear.
> In ***`Impl`*** blocks, you can define functions that are associated with your type, and
> methods are a kind of associated funvctio that let you specify the behavior that instances of your structs have.

## Chapter 6

### Enums and Pattern Matching

> In this chapter we‚Äôll look at enumerations, also referred to as enums. Enums allow you to 
> define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First, we‚Äôll define and use an enum to show 
> how an enum can encode meaning along with data. Next, we‚Äôll explore a particularly useful enum, 
> called Option, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we‚Äôll look 
> at how pattern matching in the match expression makes it easy to run different code for 
> different values of an enum. Finally, we‚Äôll cover how the if let construct is another 
> convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in your code.

> Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each language. Rust‚Äôs 
> enums are most similar to algebraic data types in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.

#### Dfining an Enum

> Enums are a way of defining custom data types in a different way than you do with structs.
